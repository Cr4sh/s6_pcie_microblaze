## General information

This repository contains Hyper-V Backdoor that might be useful for reverse engineering and exploit development purposes, it [provides an interface](https://github.com/Cr4sh/s6_pcie_microblaze/blob/master/python/payloads/DmaBackdoorHv/backdoor_client/backdoor_library/backdoor_library.cpp) for inspecting of hypervisor state (VMCS, physical/virtual memory, registers, etc.) from guest or host partition and perform VM escape attacks. 

Also, backdoor allows to inspect Secure Kernel and run 3-rd party trustlets in [Isolated User Mode](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/procthread/isolated-user-mode--ium--processes), virtualization-based security feature of Windows 10.

To deploy the backdoor you can use one of the following methods:

 * Pre-boot DMA attack over the PCI Express bus using [PCI Express DIY hacking toolkit](https://github.com/Cr4sh/s6_pcie_microblaze), also compatible with my other [Xilinx Zynq-7000 based design](https://github.com/Cr4sh/zc_pcie_dma) for DMA attacks. This method can be used with enabled UEFI Secure Boot and Intel Boot Guard.

 * To deploy Hyper-V backdoor with pre-boot DMA attack you also can use my [Pico DMA project](https://github.com/Cr4sh/pico_dma) &minus; fully autonomous hardware implant for M.2 slot based on PicoEVB development board that can run arbitrary UEFI DXE drivers payload.

 * UEFI bootkit based on [signed insecure bootloader](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4524244/security-update-for-windows-10-february-11-2020) from Kaspersky products that [was discovered](https://habr.com/en/post/446238/) by [@ValdikSS](https://twitter.com/valdikss). This method can be used with enabled UEFI Secure Boot as well.

 * UEFI bootkit based on the infection of the platform firmware stored in [SPI flash chip on the motherboard](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Cr4sh/blog/master/uefi-boot-script-expl/spi-flash-chips.jpg), which is suitable for supply chain attacks. This method can be used with enabled UEFI Secure Boot as well but only on machines without Intel Boot Guard.

 * Windows boot manager image file infection with emulation of enabled UEFI secure boot. This method requires initially disabled UEFI Secure Boot.

 * Deployment [duing runtime phase](https://github.com/Cr4sh/SmmBackdoorNg#using-together-with-hyper-v-backdoor) from already running guest or host Hyper-V partition with the help of [SMM Backdoor Next Gen](https://github.com/Cr4sh/SmmBackdoorNg) project, check its documentation for more technical details about this specific deployment method.

Backdoor supports 64-bit versions of Windows 10 1709, 1803, 1809, 1903, 1909, 2004, 20H2 and 21H1 running on Intel systems.

## Deploying the backdoor using pre-boot DMA attack

Python program `uefi_backdoor_hv.py` injects UEFI DXE driver of Hyper-V Backdoor located in `payloads/DmaBackdoorHv` folder into the target system boot sequence using pre-boot DMA attack described in "Practical DMA attacks" section of the [PCI Express DIY hacking toolkit documentation](https://github.com/Cr4sh/s6_pcie_microblaze#practical-dma-attacks). To use this program you have to perform the following steps:

 1) Power off the target computer.

 2) Connect your FPGA board used for DMA attacks to the PCI-E (or Mini PCI-E, or M.2) port of the target computer.

 3) Turn the board on and ensure that its firmware was successfully initialized. 

 4) Run the following command to start pre-boot DMA attack: 

```
$ ./uefi_backdoor_hv.py --driver payloads/DmaBackdoorHv/DmaBackdoorHv_X64.efi
```

 5) Power on the target computer, in case of successful attack after the couple of seconds you will see red debug messages screen of injected UEFI DXE driver.

An example of `uefi_backdoor_hv.py` console output after the successful attack:

```
$ ./uefi_backdoor_hv.py

[+] DONE
```

You can use `--driver` option of `uefi_backdoor_hv.py` to specify an alternative DXE driver to inject, by default the program uses `payloads/DmaBackdoorHv/DmaBackdoorHv_X64.efi` driver.


## Deploying the backdoor using signed Kaspersky bootloader

[Windows Virtualization-based Security (VBS)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/design/device-experiences/oem-vbs) uses hardware virtualization features and Hyper-V to host a number of security solutions, providing them with greatly increased protection from vulnerabilities in the operating system, and preventing the use of malicious exploits which attempt to defeat protections. One of such services is [Hypervisor-Enforced Code Integrity](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/device-guard/enable-virtualization-based-protection-of-code-integrity) which uses VBS to significantly strengthen code integrity policy enforcement.

Another example of VSB based security feature is [Windows Credential Guard](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/credential-guard/credential-guard). Hyper-V functionality is employed to logically divide the system into two separate "worlds": the normal world (VTL0) running a regular NT kernel that we’re all familiar with and a separate secure world (VTL1) running a Secure Kernel. Enabled Credential Guard causes first LSA process `lsass.exe` to remain in the Host OS running in the normal world, and a special, second LSA process (called `LSAIso.exe` – which stands for LSA Isolated) to remain as trustlet running in the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/procthread/isolated-user-mode--ium--processes">Isolated User Mode (IUM)</a> of secure world. And bacause `LSAIso.exe` trustlet responsible for protecting domain credentials is running in the secure world protected by hypervisor, attacker who managed to gain Administrator privileges within normal world is not able to use [Mimikatz](https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz) like tools to steal credentials from its memory.

Virtualization-based Security is relying on UEFI Secure Boot enabled, so, to load Hyper-V Backdoor on VBS enabled machines we should not disrupt Secure Boot configuration. One of the possible ways to do that is injecting Hyper-V Backdoor using pre-boot DMA attack which was described in [PCI Express DIY hacking toolkit](https://github.com/Cr4sh/s6_pcie_microblaze) documentation. Another possible way &minus; use 3-rd party signed bootloader as part of secure boot chain which functionality can be abused to load Hyper-V Backdoor UEFI DXE driver whithout digital sugnature verification just before passing execution to the legitimate Windows Boot Manager. 

Luckily, such digitally signed 3-rd party bootloader can be taken form [Kaspersky Rescue Disk 18](https://support.kaspersky.com/viruses/krd18). This bootloader is actually just [GRUB 2.02](https://www.gnu.org/software/grub/index.html) that was compiled without disabling some dangerous built-in commands like `rmmod` and `insmod`. This commands can be used by attacker to load malicious [GRUB chain-loader](https://www.gnu.org/software/grub/manual/grub/html_node/Chain_002dloading.html) module and effectively bypass UEFI Secure Boot.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Cr4sh/s6_pcie_microblaze/master/docs/images/backdoor_boot.png" width="694">

To install Hyper-V Backdoor along with the Kaspersky bootloader there's a program called `bootkit_installer.ps1` that embeds all needed executables. Use `-Install` command line key to install Hyper-V Backdoor as bootkit or `-Uninstall` to revert original bootloader.

## Troubleshooting

To add Kaspersky bootloader digital signature to the Secure Boot Forbidden Signature Database (dbx) Microsoft released [KB4524244](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4524244/security-update-for-windows-10-february-11-2020) security fix but later [it was removed](https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-pulls-security-update-after-reports-of-issues-affecting-some-pcs/) from Windows Update servers and enterprise update channels due to an issue affecting a sub-set of devices. If your test system where you want to run the backdoor has KB4524244 installed you can reset Secure Boot NVRAM variables (including dbx) to the factory state using appropriate option of BIOS Setup Utility menu.

Also, starting from Windows 10 2004 (build 19041) dbx variable is being updated with banned bootloader hash during operating system setup, so, if after the backdoor install your system becomes unbootable &minus; just disable or reset Secure Boot.

By default `bootkit_installer.ps1` is placing 1-st stage Kaspersky bootloader as `\EFI\Microsoft\Boot\bootmgfw.efi` (Windows EFI bootloader) and `\EFI\Boot\bootx64.efi` (default EFI bootloader) files on EFI System Parition, if after the backdoor install your system boots as usual but you don't see Hyper-V Backdoor red splash screen &minus; ensure that firmware is configured to use proper bootloader.


## Deploying the backdoor using firmware flash image infection

To infect platform firmware stored in the flash chip on the motherboard you will need some SPI flash programmer, I prefer to use cheap and widely available [FT2232H Mini Module](https://www.ftdichip.com/Support/Documents/DataSheets/Modules/DS_FT2232H_Mini_Module.pdf) from FTDI. Also, there's a [board called Tigrad](https://www.crowdsupply.com/securinghw/tigard) &minus; multi-protocol, multi-voltage tool for hardware hacking that can work as SPI flash programmer. In addition to the programmer you also will need the following tools:

 * [UEFITool](https://github.com/LongSoft/UEFITool/releases/tag/0.28.0) utility to parse and edit UEFI flash images

 * [Flashrom](https://github.com/flashrom/flashrom/releases/tag/v1.2) utility to work with SPI flash programmer

 * SOIC8 [test clip](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13153) or [probe hook](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9741) clips kit to connect programmer to the flash chip without its desoldering

First of all, you have to disassemble the machine and locate SPI flash chip with platform firmware. Usually, it's [W25Q64](https://www.winbond.com/resource-files/w25q64fv%20revq%2006142016.pdf) or [W25Q128](https://www.winbond.com/resource-files/w25q128fv_revhh1_100913_website1.pdf) Windbond NOR flash in SOIC8 package. Then you have to connect the chip to the FT2232H Mini Module: 

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Cr4sh/s6_pcie_microblaze/master/docs/images/spi_probe.jpg" width="650">

It’s more convenient to use SOIC8 test clip than probe hook clips, but very often there’s not enough free space around the chip to place test clip. Flash chip must be connected to the channel A of FT2232 Mini Module by the following scheme:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Cr4sh/s6_pcie_microblaze/master/docs/images/spi_wiring.png" width="542">

Now you can read flash chip contents using Flashrom:

```
> flashrom -p ft2232_spi:type=2232H,port=A –r firmware.bin
```

After that you need to open dumped firmware in UEFITool, locate arbitrary UEFI DXE driver to infect and extract its PE32 image section from the firmware image:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Cr4sh/s6_pcie_microblaze/master/docs/images/uefi_tool.png" width="721">

For example, I picked `Bds.efi` DXE driver responsible for boot device selection as pretty much suitable one. Then you can infect extracted driver with Hyper-V Backdoor using `infector.py` program:

```
> python infector.py --dxe-driver DmaBackdoorHv_X64.efi --infect Bds.efi --output Bds_infected.efi
```

After that you have to replace original driver image with `Bds_infected.efi` one in UEFITool, save resulting firmware image and flash it back into the chip:

```
> flashrom -p ft2232_spi:type=2232H,port=A –w firmware_infected.bin
```

## Deploying the backdoor using Windows boot manager infection

In case when you don't have any specialized hardware and also when signed Kaspersky bootloader can't be used on your system with Secure Boot enabled you can just disable Secure Boot and deploy Hyper-V Backdoor using Windows Boot Manager image file infection. In this case Hyper-V Backdoor driver will emulate enabled Secure Boot by hooking of UEFI runtime functions so infected system will able to load all virtualization-based security features just as usual.  

To infect Windows Boot Manager you have to perform the following steps.  

Mount EFI system partition where Windows Boot Manager image file is stored:

```
C:\> mountvol S: /S
```

Backup original image file:

```
C:\> copy S:\EFI\Microsoft\Boot\bootmgfw.efi S:\EFI\Microsoft\Boot\bootmgfw_orig.efi
```

Infect original image file with Hyper-V Backdoor:

```
C:\> python .\infector.py --patch-integrity-checks --dxe-driver .\DmaBackdoorHv_X64.efi ^ 
     --infect S:\EFI\Microsoft\Boot\bootmgfw_orig.efi ^
     --output S:\EFI\Microsoft\Boot\bootmgfw.efi

[+] Target image to infect: S:\EFI\Microsoft\Boot\bootmgfw_orig.efi
[+] DXE driver: .\DmaBackdoorHv_X64.efi
[+] Output file: S:\EFI\Microsoft\Boot\bootmgfw.efi

Characteristics of .reloc section was changed to RWX
New entry point RVA is 0x001bfe44

New image size is 0x001c20a0
[+] bootmgr!BmFwVerifySelfIntegrity() signature found at offset 0x0002a25c
[+] DONE
```

Unmount EFI system partition:

```
C:\> mountvol S: /D
```

After that you can restart your system, disable Secure Boot in setup menu and boot into the Windows.

Please pay attention that passing of `--patch-integrity-checks` command line option to the `infector.py` program is mandatory to disable self check of Windows Boot Manager image integrity, in other case it will not able to boot.


## Basic usage

Client program `backdoor_client.exe` is used to interact with the backdoor from Hyper-V guest or host partition. 

Check if backdoor is loaded:

```
> .\backdoor_client.exe 0

On the example above you can see LSAIso trustlet process that belongs to the Windows Credential Guard and demo trustlet that was loaded using the Hyper-V Backdoor. In order to execute the trustlet in Isolated User Mode Microsoft introduced `CREATE_SECURE_PROCESS` flag of `CreateProcess` [API function](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/procthread/process-creation-flags). Trustlet executable must have valid Microsoft digital signature with the Windows System Component Verification (1.3.6.1.4.311.10.3.6) Enhanced Key Usage property. To bypass this requirement I made `trustlet_loader.exe` tool that utilizes Hyper-V Backdoor functionality to perform in-memory patching of `skci.dll` image responsible for VTL1 code integrity used by Secure Kernel.

Example of loading 3-rd party VTL1 trustlet:

Trustlet executable image also contains the structure called [Image Policy Metadata](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/ns-wdm-_image_policy_metadata) that dascribes its capabilities. Among various interesting things it has `ImagePolicyIdDebug` property, it tells the Secure Kernel if it's possible to attach debugger to the trustlet process or not.

From the example above you can see that LSAIso trustlet has `ImagePolicyIdDebug` set to zero, it prevents the attacker from attaching debugger to this process and compromising its memory contents:

> C:\Debuggers\x64\cdb.exe -pn LsaIso.exe

Microsoft (R) Windows Debugger Version 10.0.18362.1 AMD64
Copyright (c) Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.

Cannot debug pid 792, NTSTATUS 0xC0000022
    "{Access Denied}  A process has requested access to an object, but has not been granted those access rights."
Debuggee initialization failed, NTSTATUS 0xC0000022
{Access Denied}  A process has requested access to an object, but has not been granted those access rights.
```

Hyper-V Backdoor client allows to patch `ImagePolicyIdDebug` property of specified trustlet process to allow its debugging:

```

## Building from the source code

To build Hyper-V Backdoor UEFI DXE driver you have to perform the following steps:

 1. Copy `payloads` subdirectory into the [EDK2](https://github.com/tianocore/edk2) source code directory.

 2. Edit EDK2 `Conf/target.txt` file and set `ACTIVE_PLATFORM` value to `OvmfPkg/OvmfPkgX64.dsc`.

 3. Edit EDK2 `OvmfPkg/OvmfPkgX64.dsc` and add `payloads/DmaBackdoorHv/DmaBackdoorHv.inf` line at the end of the file.

 4. Run Visual Studio Command Prompt and cd to the EDK2 directory.

 5. Run `Edk2Setup.bat --pull` to configure build environment and download required binaries.

 6. Run `cd payloads/DmaBackdoorHv && nmake` to build DXE driver.

 7. Run `nmake orom` to generate UEFI option ROM.

 8. Open [WSL command prompt](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) and run `make chainloader` to download GRUB2, apply `grub-2.02_chainloader.patch` and build chain-loader module.

 9. Run `nmake installer` to generate `bootkit_installer.ps1` program.

 10. To build backdoor client you need Python 2.7.x, Visual Studio 2013 or newer and [Windows Driver Kit 7.1.0](https://www.microsoft.com/en-sg/download/details.aspx?id=11800). Edit WDK folders path in `wdk_dirs.props` and `wdk_dirs_amd64.props` files and then just compile `backdoor_client.sln` solution in Visual Studio.
